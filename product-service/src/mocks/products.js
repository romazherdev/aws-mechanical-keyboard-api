        description: 'This is the 2nd generation of the Sword series. The case is made from CNC all-aluminum and has a four-stage color separation design that allows you to see the separation from multiple angles. It also has a detachable magnetic top that can be changed to achieve new looks. Additional colors will also be added in the future. The Sword series are the only keyboards on the market with a metal case and the Varmilo EC switches. The top mount structure boasts a gasket mount, which is a silicone strip added between the PCB at the top and bottom of the case. This strip reduces vibration when a key is pressed. The keyboard also utilizes a silicone ring between the PCB and screw holes along with a built-in sound absorbing pad to reduce vibration and pinging. These techniques are usually reserved for high end custom keyboards only.',
